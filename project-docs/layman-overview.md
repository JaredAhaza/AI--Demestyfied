# 🧠 TeamMind AI: A Simple Overview

## What is it?
TeamMind AI is like a smart, 24/7 "buddy" for every member of your team. Whether you are a brand new hire trying to figure out where the bathroom is (metaphorically speaking) or a senior engineer needing to remember a specific deployment command, TeamMind AI has the answer.

## Why did we build it?
Imagine joining a new company. You have 50 PDFs to read, 10 different Wiki pages, and you don't know who to ask for help. It's overwhelming.
On the flip side, imagine being the team lead. You answer the same "how do I install the software?" question 5 times a week. It's exhausting.

TeamMind AI solves both problems by putting all that scattered knowledge into one simple chat interface.

## How does it work? (The Simple Version)
1.  **It Reads**: We feed it all your team's documents (PDFs, Word docs, Markdown files).
2.  **It Remembers**: It organizes this information so it can find it instantly.
3.  **It Chats**: You ask a question in plain English.
4.  **It Answers**: It finds the exact page in your documents and uses AI to summarize the answer for you.
5.  **It Speaks**: It even has a "Narrator" mode that explains complex things in a friendly voice, so you don't have to read walls of text.

## Who is it for?
*   **New Hires**: Use "Onboarding Mode" to get a friendly, guided welcome.
*   **Existing Team**: Use "Knowledge Mode" to get instant facts without bugging coworkers.
*   **Managers**: Spend less time answering repetitive questions and more time leading.

## The "Cool Factor"
Most bots just give you text. Ours gives you a **Voice Narrator** that simplifies technical jargon into friendly audio explanations, making learning feel less like work and more like a conversation.
